### How does it work?

Students and teachers may individually create accounts. **There is no method to recover lost passwords.** Additionally, do NOT reuse passwords on this website. While this website does practice some basic security standards, it is not enough to risk your data over. Here are the credentials of some premade accounts:

**Student account**
- Username: guest
- Password: guest


**Teacher account**
- Username: teacher2
- Password: teacher2


Teacher accounts can **create a course** as shown here:

In turn, students may join the courses using the same course codes (the refreshing of the page in this GIF is done off the recording window):
